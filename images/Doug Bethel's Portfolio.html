            <p class="paragraph1"> So a little about me, I am a technology enthusiast who has spent the early part of my career working in telecom and helping enterprises navigating the world of packet transport. However, while doing this I developed an interest in the content traversing
            the network and thought it would really be cool to learn how to develop my own content and create my own web based applications.</p>
            <p class="paragrapgh2"> It has been a fun and challenging journey so far, my portfolio will put on all the skills I have learned thus far, and what I am willing to do to make quality programs and collaborate with teammates. Let me know if you would like me to work with
            or take a look at you current web development projects.</p>
